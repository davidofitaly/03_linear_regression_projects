# Linear Regression Projects

This repository contains two projects focused on linear regression techniques. The projects demonstrate the application of linear regression on different datasets, including generated data and the California Housing dataset.

## Projects

### 01 Make Regression Project

This project generates a synthetic regression dataset using the `make_regression` function from Scikit-Learn. The dataset is used to demonstrate basic concepts of linear regression and how to fit a linear model to the data.

### 02 California Housing Project

This project uses the California Housing dataset to predict house prices based on various features such as population, median income, and house age. The project explores different aspects of linear regression and provides insights into the relationships between variables.

## Project Descriptions

### 01 Make Regression Project
This notebook demonstrates how to create a synthetic dataset using Scikit-Learn's `make_regression` function and apply linear regression to model the data.

### 02 California Housing Project
This notebook applies linear regression to the California Housing dataset. It includes exploratory data analysis, model fitting, and evaluation of the regression model's performance.
